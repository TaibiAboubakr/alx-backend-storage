This directory contains code examples related to NoSQL databases.

## Description
NoSQL databases, often referred to as "Not Only SQL," are a type of database management system that provides mechanisms for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in ways other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, scale horizontally across many servers, and provide high availability and fault tolerance.
